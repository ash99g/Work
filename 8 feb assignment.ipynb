    "# Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans.Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that “shows” only essential attributes and “hides” unnecessary information. \n",
    "#     The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users. \n",
    "#     Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only relevant details of the object to the user.\n",
    "#     It helps in reducing programming complexity and efforts. It is one of the most important concepts of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Example\n",
    "#  You can start a car by turning the key or pressing the start button. You don't need to know how the engine is getting started, what all components your car has. \n",
    "#  The car internal implementation and complex logic is completely hidden from the user."
