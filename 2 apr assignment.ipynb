    "Q1. What is the purpose of grid search cv in machine learning, and how does it work?\n",
    "Ans.GridSearchCV is a technique for finding the optimal parameter values from a given set of parameters in a grid. It's essentially a cross-       validation technique. The model as well as the parameters must be entered. After extracting the best parameter values, predictions are         made.\n",
    "    Cross validation works by splitting our dataset into random groups, holding one group out as the test, and training the model on the           remaining groups."

    "Q2. Describe the difference between grid search cv and randomize search cv, and when might you choose\n",
    "    one over the other?\n",
    "Ans.In Grid Search, we try every combination of a preset list of values of the hyper-parameters and choose the best combination based on the       cross-validation score.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Random search tries random combinations of a range of values (we have to define the number iterations). It is good at testing a wide range     of values and normally it reaches a very good combination very fast, but the problem that it doesnâ€™t guarantee to give the best parameter       combination.\n",
    "    On the other hand, Grid search will give the best combination but it can take a lot of time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Random search is faster than grid search and should always be used when you have a large parameter space. It is also a good idea to use         both random search and grid search to get the best possible results."

    "Q3. What is data leakage, and why is it a problem in machine learning? Provide an example.\n",
    "Ans.Data leakage is one of the major problems in machine learning which occurs when the data that we are using to train an ML algorithm has the     information the model is trying to predict. It is a situation that causes unpredictable and bad prediction outcomes after model deployment.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Data leakage problem generally occurs when training data already has information about what the model is trying to predict. Although this       scenario looks like cheating but in technical words, we call it leakage, as it is an accidental scenario.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The most obvious and easy-to-understand cause of data leakage is to include the target variable as a feature. What happens is that after       including the target variable as a feature, our purpose of prediction got destroyed. This is likely to be done by mistake but while             modelling any ML model, you have to make sure that the target variable is differentiated from the set of features."

    "Q4. How can you prevent data leakage when building a machine learning model?\n",
    "Ans.One of the best ways to get rid of data leakage is to perform k-fold cross validation where the overall data is divided into k parts. After     dividing into k parts, we use each part as the cross-validation data and the remaining as training data."

The matrix compares the actual target values with those predicted by the machine learning model.This gives us a holistic view of       how well our classification model is performing and what kinds of errors it is making."

When applying insights or predictions from the model to real-world business choices, this knowledge is important."
